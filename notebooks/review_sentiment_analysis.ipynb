After that, they allowed us total privacy in our treehouse apartment retreat. The apartment was our perfect home away from home after expoloring all that Columbia City and Seattle has to offer. In Columbia City, we hit up the local Farmer's Market, listened to some great live music during Beatwalk, perused the little shops and galleries and enjoyed delicious coffee and meals all within walking distance of the house. The location is convenient to the major highways as well, so downtown and the airport were extremely accessible and just a quick 10-15 minute drive. The apartment is just as described and pictured, immaculately clean with all the bases covered. The bed was extrmemely plush and comfortable, probably some of the best sleep we've had in a long while. We had a truly wonderful experience and would highly recommend Jay and his Columbia City Treehouse to anyone visiting Seattle!"

The kitchen had all of the necessary cooking utensils and was a great space. The big bathtub was a bonus and the water pressure was great. The covered outdoor patio was awesome and got a lot of use. There is no TV which was nice because it forced us to talk to each other and not be lazy while on vacation-- haha! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The location was amazing. We ended up getting a rental car because we wanted to visit Mount Rainier and the Olympic Peninsula; however, it was not necessary. Just a couple of blocks to the center of Fremont for shops, restaurants, and bars. There is a pizza shop a block away that is open until 3:00am which was great for after a late night. There was never an issue with parking on the street in front of the house. We looked into taking buses into downtown Seattle, but realized that for a few more dollars, we could uber in half the time. The most we paid for an uber was $20 because it was a \\\"surge\\\" from downtown to the oasis because of Amazon's anniversary party at one of the stadiums-- every other time we paid between $10 and $15 each way (downtown, Ballard Locks, University area). \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Manuela was on vacation for the first half of our stay, but she put us in contact with her husband who was very helpful-- especially with the laundry. Both of them were very quick to answer our questions. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>As has been mentioned in other reviews, you can definitely hear the family walking around upstairs. I am a light sleeper when not at home, so it did wake me up; however, it made sure we got an early start every day and got the most out of our trip. My husband, on the other hand, slept through it no problem. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone that is looking to spend some time in Seattle. Next time we have the opportunity to visit Seattle, we are definitely hoping the Fremont Urban Oasis is available! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\", \"polarity\": 0.9908}, {\"listing_id\": 2693700, \"date\": \"2015-07-29T00:00:00\", \"reviewer_id\": 15121499, \"comments\": \"I could fill pages with great things about Manuala and her lovely, lovely, wonderful listing.

I want to mention also that I first made a reservation for 2, but at the last minute needed to update it to 3 guests. Christy was very accommodating and we were able to add another guest for a small fee, which took less than 5 minutes! Overall, communication was great and quick! All instructions were clear for both check-in and check-out. We would definitely stay here again!

There is also a coffee maker with some pods that we didn\\u2019t use. <br/>My husband and I stayed here for 5 days as we had to work from home before our new home was ready. We thought that the place is exceptionally comfortable for shorter stays of 1-2 days. However, for longer term stays it can get hard. There is no kitchen, no place to wash any plates or utensils you may use. The air conditioning/heating was also a bit tricky to work with as I guess it is heated from vents coming from the main unit upstairs and no proper control over it. We did find that the living room was very cold (Christy had a spare space heater for this) and the room would suddenly get very warm in the early hours. <br/><br/>The listing also doesn\\u2019t mention that the place is like a semi-basement.

There was one major disappointment (which has since been corrected in the unit description since the time of my booking) which was that the sofa was listed as a pull-out bed (during booking) and once we arrived, a note on the table stated the pull out bed was broken and could not be used.  I slept on the couch.<br/><br/>Note to summer travelers - we arrived at the end of July where the temperature was in the 90's outside, therefore much warmer inside the basement.  The main room has a tiny glass pop-out contained within the existing window for airflow.  It's really not enough, but Christy does have a small fan for use in the main room.  The bedroom has 2 windows and a larger fan, but no real airflow.   <br/>I would highly recommend this one-bed unit in the cold/cooler months because it states there is heating (and there are vents) - but the heating controls are not in the basement unit, so not sure how your comfort would be regulated.<br/>Hope this information is helpful when choosing your stay.<br/>Lisa\", \"polarity\": 0.9357}, {\"listing_id\": 26961134, \"date\": \"2022-08-07T00:00:00\", \"reviewer_id\": 59832457, \"comments\": \"Loved staying at Christy\\u2019s place for an eventful weekend in the city.

More importantly, the owner is the most rude, unprofessional, unfriendly, inconsiderate and arrogant Air B&B owner I've ever encountered in my past Air B&B history. I had an issue that required his attention, and no matter how many times I emailed him and asked him to call me, over and over again, explaining that I have a real issue that needs his attention ASAP, he completely ignored me and refused to as much as reply to me by email or by phone in order to assist me with this issue. I can't even believe anyone would stay at a dog house like this, but even more so, when the owner is so incredibly rude, careless, inconsiderate and impolite!!

            "name": "I had a terrible experience for my 8 days' stay.  Two major problems for this Airbnb listing: (1) both the owner and the host are not around (the host Alyssa said that she was in Houston during my stay), and as a result, any guest would be in trouble if there is anything wrong or if the guest needs anything during the stay (I will have a longer explanation later to report my own experience), and (2) the Host Alyssa has little passion or professionalism for hosting and has zero empathy for her guest.  As a result, when something goes wrong (for example, when the apartment was dirty upon my arrival and when both the internet and laundry  were not working during my entire 8 days' stay, Alyssa's response was that I shouldn't complain but should be happy.  Previous guests were happy, as she has claimed.<br/><br/>Below are the details of my stay.   I will start first with some positive comments about the apartment:  (1) it is about 10 minutes' walk to the Convention Center and Hyatt Seattle hotels where major conferences take place.  (2) I do not have any contact with the owner, but I can imagine she is a small woman who chose a very comfortable bed and several mirrors throughout the apartment.  (3) There were a few homeless people around but they did not bother me, although I was advised by local people that I should not go out alone after dark. (4) The apartment is walking distance (<30 minutes) to major sightseeings in Seattle. <br/><br/>Now are the cons:<br/><br/>(1) The Kitchen is almost not usable.  Although there is a kitchen with working stove, dishwasher, a few plates and pans, there isn't anything essential such as oil, salt and pepper, or any spice as they have advised.  There is no cutting board. There is no toaster.  I do not drink coffee so can't comment on coffee maker.   <br/><br/>(2) The apartment is not what it has been advertised.  In addition to lacking kitchen supplies, it also does not have soap.  It does provide shampoo and conditioner.  It provides towels (black and blue).  However due to poor quality, the white towels have blue spots.  The blue towels are not usable as the blue materials fall off when you use them.<br/><br/>(3) The checking in time is not flexible.  I was told that I must check in either 4pm or 4:30pm.  I can't check in earlier than that, nor can I check in later.  This would post a huge problem for those whose flights have odd hours.   Upon check in, the person assigned by the host, who showed no interests in her job, did not show me anything about the apartment except for giving me the keys, letting me know the check out time, and showing me where the laundry machines are.<br/><br/>(4) The Host and the owners are not local, so if anything goes wrong, the guest suffers.  The problems started upon arrival.  I found a full trash left from the previous client.  I immediately messaged Alyssa.  Rather than finding someone to pick up the trash, Alyssa instead messaged me where I should throw away the trash --- excuse me?  I am a guest and it is not my duty to clean up other guest's trash!   Later I found that the wireless internet was not working.  I messaged Alyssa three times on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 about the internet problem before she finally replied on Day 3 that she will try to address the issue.  She first said that the account information needed to be updated--which did not work--- and later on she changed her story.  She said that the wireless internet should be working, that the previous guests did not have problems, and that the building has the wireless internet.  She wanted me to fix the machine, and to find time to meet with a technician who ended up never showed up.  So there has been no internet connection throughout my 8 days of stay.  Can you image that anyone could survive anywhere without the internet nowadays?  Rather than  being empathy of my situation (I ended up doing my work at the conference center), the Host Alyssa blamed me for no internet connection and advised me \"to be happy and enjoy the rest of the stay\"!<br/><br/>This is not the end of the story.   On the first night of arrival, I found that both pillows (the only pillows provided by the Host) smelled bad, kind of nasty musty smell.  I reported to the host right away.  I believed that the bad smell resemble something that had not been dried after being wet for many days.  Of course, I never used those dirty pillows during my entire stay.   I found out the reason for the bad smell on Day 3, after I used the laundry machine.  The washer is not working.  My full load of clothes were in the big pool of water, strained overnight.  When I opened the drier, I found a full load of wet towels (that must have been left in by the house cleaning team before my arrival) that had the same smell of the pillows -- the nasty musty smell.  Now the problem is that my full load of clothes are in the bad laundry machines.  What shall I do?   So I messaged Alyssa and reported the issues of laundry.  Rather than trying to be helpful, she said that I should be aware of the problem as they also listed a public laundry room that I could use as an alternative.   Excuse me?   Nobody has told me that the laundry is not working.   If I know that the apartment has no internet, nor laundry --- which should have as both were listed as their amenities.  Moreover, if anyone has told me that the laundry is not working, I would not upload my full load of clothes into a bad machine.  With that, I even did not have clothes to wear at"

The location was good, but everything else has been given 1 star for good reason. <br/><br/>When Moe messaged us after the first night, we let him know that the place was absolutely unclean and that his posting was misleading, so most of our party just left town because of how unclean the place was and how unsafe it was for their children - it is impossible to find a place the same day for 8 people and children. The other 4 of us who stayed only did because we couldn't find, and couldn't afford, another place on short notice after paying for this place and we weren't going to miss out on our plans in town because of this. We let Moe know this, but he denied there was anyway it could be unclean - so we sent him dozens of pictures. He continued to deny any responsibility even after all the pictures we submitted, so we are now leaving this review and going directly to Airbnb. <br/><br/>First of all, the pictures on the ad are years old. There are items that are not in the house anymore, or if they are, they are years older and the place has not been taken care of adequately - let alone sufficiently cleaned regularly. <br/><br/>There were items from previous guests left all over the house - a pacifier, an earplug in a bed, a receipt at the bottom of another bed, a large earring, and a t-shirt under a blanket on a living room chair. There was a broken step on the stairs leading to the basement. The kitchen sink was full of hair. The dryer had wet towels and bedding in it. There was old popcorn all over the floor from the popcorn machine downstairs. There was dirt and food on the floor all throughout the kitchen and dining area. There were ant traps full of dead ants in plain sight. Half the blinds were missing in the master bedroom so you couldn't fully close them for privacy. They obviously did not clean or turn down the beds with new sheets. The beds in the bunkbed room were unmade, and just stuffed full of dirty sheets, pillows and mattress covers. There is a small unlocked door upstairs that just leads to a little closet full of exposed insulation and spiderwebs. They said there would be a children's gate for the stairs, but there wasn't. Outside the lawn was dead, along with all the plants and trees around the house, there were loose bricks strewn about the garden area (all dirt) by the ping pong table. The chairs on the patio were completely rusted through on the bottom which was a danger to our children. There were huge spiderwebs all throughout the back patio railing. The sauna didn't work at all. The hot tub had a bunch of dirt and rocks in it, and smelled like straight chlorine - like they hadn't properly maintained it but rather just poured a bunch of chlorine in it. The ping pong table was uncovered and warped with a huge puddle on it, so it was unplayable - there were no balls to use anyway. <br/><br/>This is the worst Airbnb experience we have ever had, and the only time we have ever left a bad review. We gave Moe the chance to apologize and do something about our terrible experience due to their lack of cleaning and property management, but he refused to do anything. He should not be allowed to continue providing misleading ads and unclean properties on this site."

More importantly, the owner is the most rude, unprofessional, unfriendly, inconsiderate and arrogant Air B&B owner I've ever encountered in my past Air B&B history. I had an issue that required his attention, and no matter how many times I emailed him and asked him to call me, over and over again, explaining that I have a real issue that needs his attention ASAP, he completely ignored me and refused to as much as reply to me by email or by phone in order to assist me with this issue.

As a result, when something goes wrong (for example, when the apartment was dirty upon my arrival and when both the internet and laundry  were not working during my entire 8 days' stay, Alyssa's response was that I shouldn't complain but should be happy.

            "name": "We so loved our stay in this sweet, cozy Airbnb!  The unit is an entirely separate and private space on the 2nd floor of a restored Craftsman house.  Jocelyn and Steve live downstairs, but unless you've made plans to visit, it's unlikely you'll cross paths.  They are very accommodating and responsive hosts, and they most certainly want their guests to have a great stay.  We loved the apartment's separate entrance (up a set of outdoor stairs on the side of the house), and really appreciated the easy and convenient lock system, which didn't require a key.  The space is so great; it's light and bright, airy and oh-so-clean.  We felt like we were in a little (although it certainly isn't tiny by any means) nest among the trees.  The furnishings and little touches are all very stylish, charming and well thought-out.  There are many gracious little offerings---coffee, Lacroix, eggs, a little wine and beer, snacks, flowers in a vase (love that), and more. The very nice kitchen is well-stocked, with plenty of spices, olive oil, pots and pans, etc, and there's a nice little laundry room, too, with an extremely nice washer and dryer (be careful---I put some stuff in the dryer late at night, only to see 20 minutes later that the washer and dryer are to be used from 9am-9pm;  hope I didn't wake our hosts!).   Off the kitchen is a cozy little living area with a TV and nice windows. There's also a toy (yes, toy!) closet right at the entrance that had some great things in it.  We used the walking sticks and camelback, but they also had a really nice picnic basket and other fun stuff that we didn't get to.  There's a sweet little balcony off a kind of bonus room that has a desk and a day-bed that was great for a nap!   The balcony was really cute with just enough room for a high-top table and 2 stools, and an Adirondack chair, where my husband did a lot of reading. And it was a pleasure to just hang out on the balcony and have a glass of wine.  The bathroom was just perfect--a good size, and filled with natural light, something I really appreciate and look for in a place.  It has a giant skylight with a window that can very easily be opened or closed, and another little window that created a sweet little cross-breeze.  We had most of the windows open in the place while we were in it, and it was so nice and breezy. One of our favorite things was (were?) the two good-sized original windows over the kitchen sink, which opened into the room by a pull chain.  They were so charming, and brought in a nice breeze.  Finally, the bedroom is great--very cozy and inviting.  The mattress is fairly firm, but I really liked it.  Jocelyn and Steve were kind enough to provide two really nice and small high-end fans for us,  as I can't sleep without a fan, haha.  They definitely did the trick. As far as the the neighborhood--it's wonderful!  Queen Anne is filled with hills and charming old homes, and there are great restaurants and shops, a major grocery store, a drug store and a Trader Joes within a few blocks.  We walked for miles every day;  if you walk toward downtown on Queen Anne, you'll descend a really steep hill, which becomes a great work-out on your return trip!  We just loved everything about this place and where it was located.  Thank you, Jocelyn and Steve,  for such a fun and special experience!"

I could write pages here but will try to nutshell it.  <br/><br/>The neighborhood itself is atop a beautiful hill with stunning views as you stroll around the quiet streets. I did not have a car and I really enjoyed discovering the area on foot.  The neighborhood has beautiful pathways, \"secret stairs\" and gorgeous houses to admire as you pass by. Alki Beach is a pleasant 20 minute hike downhill with Panoramic views of Puget Sound  the whole way.  Just 15 minutes on foot in the other direction, the Junction's delicious food, good-vibe bars, artsy shops and an awesome Sunday Farmer's Market await. Ask Pam about the hidden Speakeasy!  I enjoyed being in the hustle and bustle all day and then returning to the peace and quiet of Pam's neighborhood at night.  <br/><br/> Pam's cottages are in the tranquil and serene setting of  her private backyard so you feel like you're nestled right into a lush resort.  There is such a wonderful feeling throughout the indoor and outdoor spaces.  I loved having the two separate adjacent cottages and going between them.  It is all laid out very beautifully and it feels like you're living in a garden. The cottages and surrounding area just invite you to come in and relax.  <br/><br/>  The cottages are well-appointed, beautifully styled and immaculately clean.  They feel immensely bright, cheerful and uplifting.   Pam has managed to create a sense of tastefully modern and down-home cozy at the same time.  I loved the big shower and the bed is super comfy.  I also loved the extra coffee and snacks!  Pam has added many perfect little details that make this place unique....too many to list here!<br/><br/>Pam is the most gracious and helpful host as well.  She went well above and beyond the norm to make sure all was well.  I truly enjoyed meeting her, her mom and her dogs during my stay.  She was very accommodating and responsive and it is evident that she really wants her guests to have a good experience.  I was very grateful that she kept my bag at her house on both check in and check out days so that I could continue exploring unencumbered until leaving for the airport.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot say enough about my visit here.  Staying at Pam's place definitely added an element of heart and fun to my first adventure in the West Seattle area."

We come to Seattle often, but have been unlucky in scoring SkyCabin again until just recently. The neighborhood  (Eastlake) is wonderful, with good walking opportunities, and nice little restaurants and coffee shops nearby.  There's a great little market/wine shop that requires a picturesque little walk to get to. One day my husband and I walked around the whole of Lake Union, and Gillian offered up some great tips.  We'd take that walk again in a heartbeat. Now, the place itself! The view from SkyCabin of Lake Union is extraordinary, as it's unimpeded, and well, it's just a gorgeous view!   The living room,  kitchen and yoga/office have the same view overlooking the lake, with large and beautiful windows. The yoga/office is off a deck, by the way.   Man, we loved that deck; I just wish it had a BBQ. I love the big, interesting and colorful  rug in the living room, the large statement lamp, the cool and comfortable couch, and all the fun and thoughtful touches throughout. The kitchen is quite tiny, but oh-so-charming.  It's incorporated into the living area, so those magnificent views are right there to be had.  The bedroom has the same view if the doors to the living room are open. The bedroom is cozy and a little darker, but it has nice windows to open up for a cross-breeze.  Off the bedroom is a bathroom with the best shower/tub combo (all beautifully tiled) with multiple heads. And heated floors!  While that wasn't something we had to have in the summer, I can imagine how delicious that would be on a cold and rainy day.  Something else that I loved about the place was the lighting. There were lovely lamps all around, and dimmers on overhead lighting.  This creates a warm and cozy environment, and makes it so much more visually interesting and appealing. And the light-filtering shades that can be pulled down on all the lakeside windows are a great idea, as it can get warm up high in that neat old house.  There is no A/C, but Gillian provided a great fan, and it cooled down nicely at night. Skycabin feels like what its name implies--that you're in a cozy little place up high. The warm birch veneers  and skylights help make it feel this way, as well.  And as for Gillian and Tony--they're so great!  They're friendly and informative, easy-going, and quick to respond.  We so enjoyed our interactions with them.  Skycabin is a place we hope to return to again and again."

            "name": "Unexpectedly the place was like new home since it got recently refreshed. Xiao was very reponsive and easy to communicate with. We really enjoyed this compy home and proximity to downtown Seattle. Thanks Xiao! Excellent home, great communication from start to finish , nice location - surely recommend! We enjoyed our trip thoroughly. All amenities listed were in great working order. The flow of the house was splendid and the outdoor space was amazing. Even with two kids, there was ample room. It was easy taking up the hosts and they gave us all the information very quickly after booking. Great hosts, great house, great location! Xiao's place is a great house for groups to stay in the Seattle area. It is situated just off of the south side of lake Washington with a very nice creek running right through the property. Just a few steps away is a delicious pizza restaurant and a nice forested park for hiking. Traffic is very minimal in the area and creates virtually no noise. There is also access to a freeway that goes north to Seattle and a light rail station, with free parking, only a few miles from the location. This house was clean, spacious, and secure. Check-in instructions were great and host was quick to respond to messages. Would have given a 5 star review but we thought the beds were uncomfortable, we had to buy some kitchen basics in order to prepare meals, and we did not see any ducks during our stay. Beautiful home close to Lake Washington.  My family and I had a wonderful time walking the nearby trail and grabbing a bite at the local pizzeria.  <br/><br/>Xiao was very attentive to the couple of needs we had during our stay.  We would definitely stay here again! Oh where do I start! From the moment you pull up to the home, you'll find a very large driveway with a yard that has a really cool creek! the sound of the water is so relaxing. Entrance to the home was easy as Xiao's communication was very thorough. This is such a beautiful, and cozy home. Very thoughtful touches were added to make our stay as relaxing as possible.  Very spacious indoor AND outdoor area. Everything we needed was here. and the area / town is beautiful as well. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL STAY!!! The property was true to its listing. It can accommodate a larger party, the home was clean and comfortable. A bit farther from the central city, but about 20 min away. Clean, roomy house in South Seattle. We were in town for our daughters wedding in Ranier Beach, and it was great. Nice little walking path just up the road, too. Amazing home & an incredibly communicative and accommodating host! If I were to choose a place to recommend for anyone that will be traveling to Seattle, and wants to experience what the PNW has to offer, Xiao’s Airbnb would be the first that comes to mind. <br/><br/>From the picturesque surroundings, to how clean & well stocked the house is, there’s nothing bad I could say about the home at all. It is also incredibly spacious. The house is also conveniently located to a number of convenient stores, as well as a local bakery called Umami Kushi that serves up excellent beignets and stuffed baked goods.<br/><br/>Xiao was also quick to respond to any questions that I had, and was thorough and concise with her communication. Our check-in was smooth and there wasn’t any hiccups along the way. We enjoyed a perfect stay at this private home in south Seattle. The perfect home base for us visiting friends and family. We appreciated the home's security and bathroom/shower updates. Host communication was excellent. Really an enjoyable stay within an easy drive to everywhere we needed to go. Plus pizza and Kubota garden. We had a great stay in this house. The playground and pizza place nearby were convenient, and the stream running through the front yard was beautiful.  Would absolutely stay there again. We were able to get into this house on short notice after another one fell through. Nice place, true to pictures and clean. Really liked walking up the street to the park and walking up the valley in the snow. Kids were able to sled in the park behind the house. Fun to watch the family get out of the car and look up at the trees, not realizing it was the creek they were hearing and not the wind. this was a wonderful home. very spacious with a clawfoot bathtub and open fully stocked kitchen and private creek. Our team of 4 got thier own room and bed.<br/><br/>the neighbohood is quiet and very family friendly. getting from renton area to downtown is a 14 min drive but there are plenty of shops in the area to visit.<br/><br/>the gate to enter the property isnt automated so if you have a car some one has to get out to manually unlock the gate. Clean and nice decorated house with everything we needed for the trip.   Host responded quickly to an unexpected issue.    Really enjoyed our stay. Very nice. Just what we wanted and asked for. 100/10 on our experience with Xiao. Responds quickly to questions and the whole experience was as painless as she could make it. The home itself was nice & cozy and equipped with the essentials you would need during your stay. It was perfect for our family of 7 and a safe enough space for kids to roam and explore within the house."

            "name": "The house is so comfortable and clean. It has everything you need and makes you feel like home. I like the one floor house compared some 3 floor townhouse it’s easy for everything. Ryan is very helpful with all questions and service. Great experience here. Our family had a wonderful stay at Ryan’s place. Check-in was easy; location was great with quick access to highway; house was beautiful and well stocked; great neighborhood with restaurants nearby. The location was great as it was close to downtown and easily accessible by car or bus. It is recently remodeled with new furnishings and very spacious and clean. Ryan was also very responsive to our questions and was a great host. Would definitely recommend! Ryan’s place was wonderful. Roomy, clean, and in a fun neighborhood. Our kids loved walking to Oxbow park (for the giant hat and boots), and we were only a short walk to downtown Georgetown!<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend! Wow! This place is extraordinarily clean and well appointed. Great modern amenities, great neighborhood. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms looked newly remodeled. Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle! Really lovely house and feels like a miracle to find a true three bedroom. Stayed for a week with two co-workers for required work meetings. House is awesomely convenient to I-5, Marginal Way and 99 as well as restaurants and things to do in Georgetown (most are walk-able!). Incredibly clean and larger than expected, there was plenty of room for all of us to spend time together... or apart. Beautiful kitchen and laundry room. Quiet and secure. Look forward to our next stay. Ryan is an attentive and thoughtful host. Thank you! Great spot! Cute place - easy to get to and close to downtown! Nice house is a great location. Would recommend. this is a lovely homey home in a very charming part of town.  with a walking adventure in every direction  😀 We enjoyed staying at Ryan’s house in Georgetown. The house is remodeled and modern mixed with a little bit of rustic charm as described. Lots of room for a family with everyone on one story. Two good bathrooms one with a nice tub. The location is good for getting to the airport or Seward park, downtown on I-5 or getting out to the beach without staying at the beach.  There is some airport noise but that is common in many places in Seattle. Proximity to The Museum of Flight is a bonus, I was able to start the day with my toddler and then send her home for a nap while i continued exploring the planes! I felt secure and happy here for 3 nights with my family. Great location, clean, and charming. Our family was staying at Ryan's place as we attended a wedding in Seattle. This was my parents first time staying at an Airbnb, and they absolutely loved it! Plenty of space to sleep, eat, and hangout. We enjoyed our stay very much. Great stay, freshly renovated and well equipped house! Great location for what we needed and Ryan is VERY responsive. Probably the easiest check-in and check-out procedure I’ve ever had for a bnb unit. And the House was great, too. Ryan’s place is very clean, beautifully updated and nicely appointed with everything you might need. Beds are comfortable & linens are great. We appreciated the big luxurious bath towels!! Plenty of the basics:paper towels,TP, garbage bags, etc which a lot of rentals skimp on. Nice neighborhood, sweet front porch & fabulous fenced outdoor area with table & chairs. We had one small issue with having very few drinking glasses but as soon as Ryan was made aware he dropped off an entire set! <br/>The house is great & Ryan is an excellent host. We recommend this little gem! Nice spot near downtown. Great if you there as a business traveler Our family enjoyed our stay at this location.  Very clean and close walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops. Comfortable beds and cozy outside patio. Easy access to airport and downtown Seattle.  Would look to use again when we return to Seattle in the future. Hello from our Indiana travel tribe.. We enjoyed Ryan’s place so much.  Extremely clean, spacious yet private feeling.  The house was so comfortable, we didn’t want to leave.  Great location between Seattle and The Airport.  The bedrooms were  a great size with comfortable beds and bedding.  We will definitely try to stay next time we visit the area. This is really a gem of a place to stay… hope you all try it out. Beautiful, well appointed home. Charming neighborhood with llvely gardens and an amazing nakery a couple blocks away. Ryan was very quick to respond when we messaged him with some questions, and his response was super helpful. Ill definitely look for an opportunity to go back! A quick-to-respond host and a beautifully renovated and spacious craftsman house with cozy beds made for an excellent stay during our trip down south. The kitchen was equipped with brand new appliances and condiments, and the beds were all comfortable to sleep in. We enjoyed the outdoor space well as the indoor space. We loved the proximity to our targeted tourist sites, and appreciated the quiet neighborhood the house is situated in. The kids found it fun to hear the planes as they came into landing and take off from the nearby airport. We have bookmarked Ryan’s place for future Seattle trips! Lovely house, clean and well taken care of. Good location near freeway, restaurants and bars but in a quiet neighborhood with a cute park nearby. The whole family enjoyed it very much. Master bedroom door sticks slightly, in the way doors in older houses often do. I wouldn’t have noticed if I didn’t have a toddler I was worried about waking. Would recommend! This place was perfect! Clean, bright, with plenty of room for six guests. Super close to Georgetown in a beautiful neighbourhood. Highly recommend! We had a little mishap with our checkin but Ryan was great helping us resolve things and being very accommodating to our needs. The location is walkable to some great restaurants and breweries. We were there for business and had no issues with the wifi. Easy parking too. Ryan had a super cozy and clean home. It was perfect for my parents and grandparents. Very warm, comfortable beds, and a nice kitchen space. Only thing is you hear the planes overhead but still 5/5. Our family loved Ryan’s place.  It had all the amenities that made our stay extremely comfortable.  The location is perfect for sightseeing, eating and walking. We would rent Ryan’s house again.  Thank you for being a responsible and responsive host. My work colleague and I enjoyed our stay. We would be happy to stay there again. Close to job site, easy commute to down town Seattle, walking distance to local Mexican, Thai, Sushi restaurants. Ryan was very helpful - we arrived on an early flight and but we were able to drop our bags at the house before check in and once the cleaner was finished we were able to check in several hours early. The home was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!"

I like the one floor house compared some 3 floor townhouse it’s easy for everything. Ryan is very helpful with all questions and service. Great experience here. Our family had a wonderful stay at Ryan’s place. Check-in was easy; location was great with quick access to highway; house was beautiful and well stocked; great neighborhood with restaurants nearby. The location was great as it was close to downtown and easily accessible by car or bus. It is recently remodeled with new furnishings and very spacious and clean. Ryan was also very responsive to our questions and was a great host. Would definitely recommend! Ryan’s place was wonderful. Roomy, clean, and in a fun neighborhood. Our kids loved walking to Oxbow park (for the giant hat and boots), and we were only a short walk to downtown Georgetown!<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend! Wow!

Georgetown is truly one of the last artsy, funky neighborhoods left in Seattle - you will be a five minute walk from the many restaurants, bars, wine tasting rooms & more in the \"downtown\" Georgetown neighborhood. It's also kid friendly as you will see many families out and pushing strollers around.<br /><br />The neighborhood is located a few miles south of the downtown Seattle core.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />This is the top unit of a completely remodeled craftsman (if bottom unit is available you can rent the whole house and have 6 beds & 4 baths!)<br /><br />This unit has the classic craftsman feel, but it has been completely remodeled with some modern touches!<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Obviously you have access to the entire unit - there is a lower unit of the house that may be rented too, so you will need to be respectful of other guests. The front yard and side yards are also yours to enjo",
