Joyce was an awesome host and made us feel right at home. My boyfriend got sick during our trip and while I was out, Joyce brought him some juice and checked up on him. She also was great at recommending restaurants and gave us lots of guide books to check out. We traveled by car and there was always a parking spot right outside her house. The cottage was quaint and surrounded by her gorgeous garden and plum tree that were delicious! There was a compost toilet (that I have to admit, took me a little while to get used to) and a shower inside since it was too cold for us to take an outdoor shower. I highly recommend staying with Joyce! A great location in Seattle to stay in!

Downtown Seattle vistas can be seen just by looking down the street, and we were able to easily get to all of our destinations (inside and outside of Seattle) during our stay.  Joyce was friendly and easy to communicate with.<br/><br/>CONS: As another reviewer said, everything felt kind of jury-rigged together, like if you bumped something the shelves would come crashing down.  There are wooden planks in the shower that aren't in the photos; these are so you don't have to stand in water.  The drain doesn't function well and there was standing water left around as late as 24 hours after a shower.  You can't set things on the little counter set up on the fridge, because the fridge is crooked and it will roll right off.  There was a wet patch on the carpet in the bedroom that never dried.  The dresser was put on little blocks to prop it off of the wet spot.  There was a faint sewage smell during our stay that I suspect was due to the drains.  Finally, I wasn't able to tell this from the pictures, but heads up that the kitchen is the same room as the bathroom.  It felt unsanitary and we didn't prep as much food as we had planned to as a result.<br/><br/>It was a great deal, we loved the location and the garden.
