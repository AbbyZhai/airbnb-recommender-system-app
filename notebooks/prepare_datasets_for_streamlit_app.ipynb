We really enjoyed this compy home and proximity to downtown Seattle. Thanks Xiao! Excellent home, great communication from start to finish , nice location - surely recommend! We enjoyed our trip thoroughly. All amenities listed were in great working order. The flow of the house was splendid and the outdoor space was amazing. Even with two kids, there was ample room. It was easy taking up the hosts and they gave us all the information very quickly after booking. Great hosts, great house, great location! Xiao's place is a great house for groups to stay in the Seattle area. It is situated just off of the south side of lake Washington with a very nice creek running right through the property. Just a few steps away is a delicious pizza restaurant and a nice forested park for hiking. Traffic is very minimal in the area and creates virtually no noise. There is also access to a freeway that goes north to Seattle and a light rail station, with free parking, only a few miles from the location. This house was clean, spacious, and secure. Check-in instructions were great and host was quick to respond to messages. Would have given a 5 star review but we thought the beds were uncomfortable, we had to buy some kitchen basics in order to prepare meals, and we did not see any ducks during our stay. Beautiful home close to Lake Washington.  My family and I had a wonderful time walking the nearby trail and grabbing a bite at the local pizzeria.  <br/><br/>Xiao was very attentive to the couple of needs we had during our stay.  We would definitely stay here again! Oh where do I start! From the moment you pull up to the home, you'll find a very large driveway with a yard that has a really cool creek! the sound of the water is so relaxing. Entrance to the home was easy as Xiao's communication was very thorough. This is such a beautiful, and cozy home. Very thoughtful touches were added to make our stay as relaxing as possible.  Very spacious indoor AND outdoor area. Everything we needed was here. and the area / town is beautiful as well. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL STAY!!! The property was true to its listing. It can accommodate a larger party, the home was clean and comfortable. A bit farther from the central city, but about 20 min away. Clean, roomy house in South Seattle. We were in town for our daughters wedding in Ranier Beach, and it was great. Nice little walking path just up the road, too. Amazing home & an incredibly communicative and accommodating host! If I were to choose a place to recommend for anyone that will be traveling to Seattle, and wants to experience what the PNW has to offer, Xiao’s Airbnb would be the first that comes to mind. <br/><br/>From the picturesque surroundings, to how clean & well stocked the house is, there’s nothing bad I could say about the home at all. It is also incredibly spacious. The house is also conveniently located to a number of convenient stores, as well as a local bakery called Umami Kushi that serves up excellent beignets and stuffed baked goods.<br/><br/>Xiao was also quick to respond to any questions that I had, and was thorough and concise with her communication. Our check-in was smooth and there wasn’t any hiccups along the way. We enjoyed a perfect stay at this private home in south Seattle. The perfect home base for us visiting friends and family. We appreciated the home's security and bathroom/shower updates. Host communication was excellent. Really an enjoyable stay within an easy drive to everywhere we needed to go. Plus pizza and Kubota garden. We had a great stay in this house. The playground and pizza place nearby were convenient, and the stream running through the front yard was beautiful.  Would absolutely stay there again. We were able to get into this house on short notice after another one fell through. Nice place, true to pictures and clean. Really liked walking up the street to the park and walking up the valley in the snow. Kids were able to sled in the park behind the house. Fun to watch the family get out of the car and look up at the trees, not realizing it was the creek they were hearing and not the wind. this was a wonderful home. very spacious with a clawfoot bathtub and open fully stocked kitchen and private creek. Our team of 4 got thier own room and bed.<br/><br/>the neighbohood is quiet and very family friendly. getting from renton area to downtown is a 14 min drive but there are plenty of shops in the area to visit.<br/><br/>the gate to enter the property isnt automated so if you have a car some one has to get out to manually unlock the gate. Clean and nice decorated house with everything we needed for the trip.   Host responded quickly to an unexpected issue.    Really enjoyed our stay. Very nice. Just what we wanted and asked for. 100/10 on our experience with Xiao. Responds quickly to questions and the whole experience was as painless as she could make it. The home itself was nice & cozy and equipped with the essentials you would need during your stay. It was perfect for our family of 7 and a safe enough space for kids to roam and explore within the house."

            "name": "The house is so comfortable and clean. It has everything you need and makes you feel like home. I like the one floor house compared some 3 floor townhouse it’s easy for everything. Ryan is very helpful with all questions and service. Great experience here. Our family had a wonderful stay at Ryan’s place. Check-in was easy; location was great with quick access to highway; house was beautiful and well stocked; great neighborhood with restaurants nearby. The location was great as it was close to downtown and easily accessible by car or bus. It is recently remodeled with new furnishings and very spacious and clean. Ryan was also very responsive to our questions and was a great host. Would definitely recommend! Ryan’s place was wonderful. Roomy, clean, and in a fun neighborhood. Our kids loved walking to Oxbow park (for the giant hat and boots), and we were only a short walk to downtown Georgetown!<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend! Wow! This place is extraordinarily clean and well appointed. Great modern amenities, great neighborhood. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms looked newly remodeled. Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle! Really lovely house and feels like a miracle to find a true three bedroom. Stayed for a week with two co-workers for required work meetings. House is awesomely convenient to I-5, Marginal Way and 99 as well as restaurants and things to do in Georgetown (most are walk-able!). Incredibly clean and larger than expected, there was plenty of room for all of us to spend time together... or apart. Beautiful kitchen and laundry room. Quiet and secure. Look forward to our next stay. Ryan is an attentive and thoughtful host. Thank you! Great spot! Cute place - easy to get to and close to downtown! Nice house is a great location. Would recommend. this is a lovely homey home in a very charming part of town.  with a walking adventure in every direction  😀 We enjoyed staying at Ryan’s house in Georgetown. The house is remodeled and modern mixed with a little bit of rustic charm as described. Lots of room for a family with everyone on one story. Two good bathrooms one with a nice tub. The location is good for getting to the airport or Seward park, downtown on I-5 or getting out to the beach without staying at the beach.  There is some airport noise but that is common in many places in Seattle. Proximity to The Museum of Flight is a bonus, I was able to start the day with my toddler and then send her home for a nap while i continued exploring the planes! I felt secure and happy here for 3 nights with my family. Great location, clean, and charming. Our family was staying at Ryan's place as we attended a wedding in Seattle. This was my parents first time staying at an Airbnb, and they absolutely loved it! Plenty of space to sleep, eat, and hangout. We enjoyed our stay very much. Great stay, freshly renovated and well equipped house! Great location for what we needed and Ryan is VERY responsive. Probably the easiest check-in and check-out procedure I’ve ever had for a bnb unit. And the House was great, too. Ryan’s place is very clean, beautifully updated and nicely appointed with everything you might need. Beds are comfortable & linens are great. We appreciated the big luxurious bath towels!! Plenty of the basics:paper towels,TP, garbage bags, etc which a lot of rentals skimp on. Nice neighborhood, sweet front porch & fabulous fenced outdoor area with table & chairs. We had one small issue with having very few drinking glasses but as soon as Ryan was made aware he dropped off an entire set! <br/>The house is great & Ryan is an excellent host. We recommend this little gem! Nice spot near downtown. Great if you there as a business traveler Our family enjoyed our stay at this location.  Very clean and close walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops. Comfortable beds and cozy outside patio. Easy access to airport and downtown Seattle.  Would look to use again when we return to Seattle in the future. Hello from our Indiana travel tribe.. We enjoyed Ryan’s place so much.  Extremely clean, spacious yet private feeling.  The house was so comfortable, we didn’t want to leave.  Great location between Seattle and The Airport.  The bedrooms were  a great size with comfortable beds and bedding.  We will definitely try to stay next time we visit the area. This is really a gem of a place to stay… hope you all try it out. Beautiful, well appointed home. Charming neighborhood with llvely gardens and an amazing nakery a couple blocks away. Ryan was very quick to respond when we messaged him with some questions, and his response was super helpful. Ill definitely look for an opportunity to go back! A quick-to-respond host and a beautifully renovated and spacious craftsman house with cozy beds made for an excellent stay during our trip down south. The kitchen was equipped with brand new appliances and condiments, and the beds were all comfortable to sleep in. We enjoyed the outdoor space well as the indoor space. We loved the proximity to our targeted tourist sites, and appreciated the quiet neighborhood the house is situated in. The kids found it fun to hear the planes as they came into landing and take off from the nearby airport. We have bookmarked Ryan’s place for future Seattle trips! Lovely house, clean and well taken care of. Good location near freeway, restaurants and bars but in a quiet neighborhood with a cute park nearby. The whole family enjoyed it very much. Master bedroom door sticks slightly, in the way doors in older houses often do. I wouldn’t have noticed if I didn’t have a toddler I was worried about waking. Would recommend! This place was perfect! Clean, bright, with plenty of room for six guests. Super close to Georgetown in a beautiful neighbourhood. Highly recommend! We had a little mishap with our checkin but Ryan was great helping us resolve things and being very accommodating to our needs. The location is walkable to some great restaurants and breweries. We were there for business and had no issues with the wifi. Easy parking too. Ryan had a super cozy and clean home. It was perfect for my parents and grandparents. Very warm, comfortable beds, and a nice kitchen space. Only thing is you hear the planes overhead but still 5/5. Our family loved Ryan’s place.  It had all the amenities that made our stay extremely comfortable.  The location is perfect for sightseeing, eating and walking. We would rent Ryan’s house again.  Thank you for being a responsible and responsive host. My work colleague and I enjoyed our stay. We would be happy to stay there again. Close to job site, easy commute to down town Seattle, walking distance to local Mexican, Thai, Sushi restaurants. Ryan was very helpful - we arrived on an early flight and but we were able to drop our bags at the house before check in and once the cleaner was finished we were able to check in several hours early. The home was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!"

Ryan was also very responsive to our questions and was a great host. Would definitely recommend! Ryan’s place was wonderful. Roomy, clean, and in a fun neighborhood.
