            "name": "Unexpectedly the place was like new home since it got recently refreshed. Xiao was very reponsive and easy to communicate with. We really enjoyed this compy home and proximity to downtown Seattle. Thanks Xiao! Excellent home, great communication from start to finish , nice location - surely recommend! We enjoyed our trip thoroughly. All amenities listed were in great working order. The flow of the house was splendid and the outdoor space was amazing. Even with two kids, there was ample room. It was easy taking up the hosts and they gave us all the information very quickly after booking. Great hosts, great house, great location! Xiao's place is a great house for groups to stay in the Seattle area. It is situated just off of the south side of lake Washington with a very nice creek running right through the property. Just a few steps away is a delicious pizza restaurant and a nice forested park for hiking. Traffic is very minimal in the area and creates virtually no noise. There is also access to a freeway that goes north to Seattle and a light rail station, with free parking, only a few miles from the location. This house was clean, spacious, and secure. Check-in instructions were great and host was quick to respond to messages. Would have given a 5 star review but we thought the beds were uncomfortable, we had to buy some kitchen basics in order to prepare meals, and we did not see any ducks during our stay. Beautiful home close to Lake Washington.  My family and I had a wonderful time walking the nearby trail and grabbing a bite at the local pizzeria.  <br/><br/>Xiao was very attentive to the couple of needs we had during our stay.  We would definitely stay here again! Oh where do I start! From the moment you pull up to the home, you'll find a very large driveway with a yard that has a really cool creek! the sound of the water is so relaxing. Entrance to the home was easy as Xiao's communication was very thorough. This is such a beautiful, and cozy home. Very thoughtful touches were added to make our stay as relaxing as possible.  Very spacious indoor AND outdoor area. Everything we needed was here. and the area / town is beautiful as well. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL STAY!!! The property was true to its listing. It can accommodate a larger party, the home was clean and comfortable. A bit farther from the central city, but about 20 min away. Clean, roomy house in South Seattle. We were in town for our daughters wedding in Ranier Beach, and it was great. Nice little walking path just up the road, too. Amazing home & an incredibly communicative and accommodating host! If I were to choose a place to recommend for anyone that will be traveling to Seattle, and wants to experience what the PNW has to offer, Xiao’s Airbnb would be the first that comes to mind. <br/><br/>From the picturesque surroundings, to how clean & well stocked the house is, there’s nothing bad I could say about the home at all. It is also incredibly spacious. The house is also conveniently located to a number of convenient stores, as well as a local bakery called Umami Kushi that serves up excellent beignets and stuffed baked goods.<br/><br/>Xiao was also quick to respond to any questions that I had, and was thorough and concise with her communication. Our check-in was smooth and there wasn’t any hiccups along the way. We enjoyed a perfect stay at this private home in south Seattle. The perfect home base for us visiting friends and family. We appreciated the home's security and bathroom/shower updates. Host communication was excellent. Really an enjoyable stay within an easy drive to everywhere we needed to go. Plus pizza and Kubota garden. We had a great stay in this house. The playground and pizza place nearby were convenient, and the stream running through the front yard was beautiful.  Would absolutely stay there again. We were able to get into this house on short notice after another one fell through. Nice place, true to pictures and clean. Really liked walking up the street to the park and walking up the valley in the snow. Kids were able to sled in the park behind the house. Fun to watch the family get out of the car and look up at the trees, not realizing it was the creek they were hearing and not the wind. this was a wonderful home. very spacious with a clawfoot bathtub and open fully stocked kitchen and private creek. Our team of 4 got thier own room and bed.<br/><br/>the neighbohood is quiet and very family friendly. getting from renton area to downtown is a 14 min drive but there are plenty of shops in the area to visit.<br/><br/>the gate to enter the property isnt automated so if you have a car some one has to get out to manually unlock the gate. Clean and nice decorated house with everything we needed for the trip.   Host responded quickly to an unexpected issue.    Really enjoyed our stay. Very nice. Just what we wanted and asked for. 100/10 on our experience with Xiao. Responds quickly to questions and the whole experience was as painless as she could make it. The home itself was nice & cozy and equipped with the essentials you would need during your stay. It was perfect for our family of 7 and a safe enough space for kids to roam and explore within the house."

I like the one floor house compared some 3 floor townhouse it’s easy for everything. Ryan is very helpful with all questions and service. Great experience here. Our family had a wonderful stay at Ryan’s place. Check-in was easy; location was great with quick access to highway; house was beautiful and well stocked; great neighborhood with restaurants nearby. The location was great as it was close to downtown and easily accessible by car or bus. It is recently remodeled with new furnishings and very spacious and clean. Ryan was also very responsive to our questions and was a great host. Would definitely recommend! Ryan’s place was wonderful. Roomy, clean, and in a fun neighborhood. Our kids loved walking to Oxbow park (for the giant hat and boots), and we were only a short walk to downtown Georgetown!<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend! Wow! This place is extraordinarily clean and well appointed. Great modern amenities, great neighborhood. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms looked newly remodeled. Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle! Really lovely house and feels like a miracle to find a true three bedroom. Stayed for a week with two co-workers for required work meetings. House is awesomely convenient to I-5, Marginal Way and 99 as well as restaurants and things to do in Georgetown (most are walk-able!). Incredibly clean and larger than expected, there was plenty of room for all of us to spend time together... or apart. Beautiful kitchen and laundry room. Quiet and secure. Look forward to our next stay. Ryan is an attentive and thoughtful host. Thank you! Great spot! Cute place - easy to get to and close to downtown! Nice house is a great location. Would recommend. this is a lovely homey home in a very charming part of town.  with a walking adventure in every direction  😀 We enjoyed staying at Ryan’s house in Georgetown. The house is remodeled and modern mixed with a little bit of rustic charm as described. Lots of room for a family with everyone on one story. Two good bathrooms one with a nice tub. The location is good for getting to the airport or Seward park, downtown on I-5 or getting out to the beach without staying at the beach.  There is some airport noise but that is common in many places in Seattle. Proximity to The Museum of Flight is a bonus, I was able to start the day with my toddler and then send her home for a nap while i continued exploring the planes! I felt secure and happy here for 3 nights with my family. Great location, clean, and charming. Our family was staying at Ryan's place as we attended a wedding in Seattle. This was my parents first time staying at an Airbnb, and they absolutely loved it! Plenty of space to sleep, eat, and hangout. We enjoyed our stay very much. Great stay, freshly renovated and well equipped house! Great location for what we needed and Ryan is VERY responsive. Probably the easiest check-in and check-out procedure I’ve ever had for a bnb unit. And the House was great, too. Ryan’s place is very clean, beautifully updated and nicely appointed with everything you might need. Beds are comfortable & linens are great. We appreciated the big luxurious bath towels!! Plenty of the basics:paper towels,TP, garbage bags, etc which a lot of rentals skimp on. Nice neighborhood, sweet front porch & fabulous fenced outdoor area with table & chairs. We had one small issue with having very few drinking glasses but as soon as Ryan was made aware he dropped off an entire set! <br/>The house is great & Ryan is an excellent host. We recommend this little gem! Nice spot near downtown. Great if you there as a business traveler Our family enjoyed our stay at this location.  Very clean and close walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops. Comfortable beds and cozy outside patio. Easy access to airport and downtown Seattle.  Would look to use again when we return to Seattle in the future. Hello from our Indiana travel tribe.. We enjoyed Ryan’s place so much.  Extremely clean, spacious yet private feeling.  The house was so comfortable, we didn’t want to leave.  Great location between Seattle and The Airport.  The bedrooms were  a great size with comfortable beds and bedding.  We will definitely try to stay next time we visit the area. This is really a gem of a place to stay… hope you all try it out. Beautiful, well appointed home. Charming neighborhood with llvely gardens and an amazing nakery a couple blocks away. Ryan was very quick to respond when we messaged him with some questions, and his response was super helpful. Ill definitely look for an opportunity to go back! A quick-to-respond host and a beautifully renovated and spacious craftsman house with cozy beds made for an excellent stay during our trip down south. The kitchen was equipped with brand new appliances and condiments, and the beds were all comfortable to sleep in. We enjoyed the outdoor space well as the indoor space. We loved the proximity to our targeted tourist sites, and appreciated the quiet neighborhood the house is situated in. The kids found it fun to hear the planes as they came into landing and take off from the nearby airport. We have bookmarked Ryan’s place for future Seattle trips! Lovely house, clean and well taken care of. Good location near freeway, restaurants and bars but in a quiet neighborhood with a cute park nearby. The whole family enjoyed it very much. Master bedroom door sticks slightly, in the way doors in older houses often do. I wouldn’t have noticed if I didn’t have a toddler I was worried about waking. Would recommend! This place was perfect! Clean, bright, with plenty of room for six guests. Super close to Georgetown in a beautiful neighbourhood. Highly recommend! We had a little mishap with our checkin but Ryan was great helping us resolve things and being very accommodating to our needs. The location is walkable to some great restaurants and breweries. We were there for business and had no issues with the wifi. Easy parking too. Ryan had a super cozy and clean home. It was perfect for my parents and grandparents. Very warm, comfortable beds, and a nice kitchen space. Only thing is you hear the planes overhead but still 5/5. Our family loved Ryan’s place.  It had all the amenities that made our stay extremely comfortable.  The location is perfect for sightseeing, eating and walking. We would rent Ryan’s house again.  Thank you for being a responsible and responsive host. My work colleague and I enjoyed our stay. We would be happy to stay there again. Close to job site, easy commute to down town Seattle, walking distance to local Mexican, Thai, Sushi restaurants. Ryan was very helpful - we arrived on an early flight and but we were able to drop our bags at the house before check in and once the cleaner was finished we were able to check in several hours early. The home was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!"

Would definitely recommend staying in this lovely home. Lovely home. Clean, pretty, quiet, peaceful, comfortable and well furnished. Fantastic location. Friendly neighbors. If you want to prepare gourmet meals and have guests, you’ll likely find it a bit challenging, but it’s perfect for a couple and guest. Loved our stay there. Cute house in a great location! 5 minute walk to the main street where you'll find lots of restaurants and coffee shops. Keep in mind, this house does have downstairs neighbors living below.

            "name": "Unexpectedly the place was like new home since it got recently refreshed. Xiao was very reponsive and easy to communicate with. We really enjoyed this compy home and proximity to downtown Seattle. Thanks Xiao! Excellent home, great communication from start to finish , nice location - surely recommend! We enjoyed our trip thoroughly. All amenities listed were in great working order. The flow of the house was splendid and the outdoor space was amazing. Even with two kids, there was ample room. It was easy taking up the hosts and they gave us all the information very quickly after booking. Great hosts, great house, great location! Xiao's place is a great house for groups to stay in the Seattle area. It is situated just off of the south side of lake Washington with a very nice creek running right through the property. Just a few steps away is a delicious pizza restaurant and a nice forested park for hiking. Traffic is very minimal in the area and creates virtually no noise. There is also access to a freeway that goes north to Seattle and a light rail station, with free parking, only a few miles from the location. This house was clean, spacious, and secure. Check-in instructions were great and host was quick to respond to messages. Would have given a 5 star review but we thought the beds were uncomfortable, we had to buy some kitchen basics in order to prepare meals, and we did not see any ducks during our stay. Beautiful home close to Lake Washington.  My family and I had a wonderful time walking the nearby trail and grabbing a bite at the local pizzeria.  <br/><br/>Xiao was very attentive to the couple of needs we had during our stay.  We would definitely stay here again! Oh where do I start! From the moment you pull up to the home, you'll find a very large driveway with a yard that has a really cool creek! the sound of the water is so relaxing. Entrance to the home was easy as Xiao's communication was very thorough. This is such a beautiful, and cozy home. Very thoughtful touches were added to make our stay as relaxing as possible.  Very spacious indoor AND outdoor area. Everything we needed was here. and the area / town is beautiful as well. THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL STAY!!! The property was true to its listing. It can accommodate a larger party, the home was clean and comfortable. A bit farther from the central city, but about 20 min away. Clean, roomy house in South Seattle. We were in town for our daughters wedding in Ranier Beach, and it was great. Nice little walking path just up the road, too. Amazing home & an incredibly communicative and accommodating host! If I were to choose a place to recommend for anyone that will be traveling to Seattle, and wants to experience what the PNW has to offer, Xiao’s Airbnb would be the first that comes to mind. <br/><br/>From the picturesque surroundings, to how clean & well stocked the house is, there’s nothing bad I could say about the home at all. It is also incredibly spacious. The house is also conveniently located to a number of convenient stores, as well as a local bakery called Umami Kushi that serves up excellent beignets and stuffed baked goods.<br/><br/>Xiao was also quick to respond to any questions that I had, and was thorough and concise with her communication. Our check-in was smooth and there wasn’t any hiccups along the way. We enjoyed a perfect stay at this private home in south Seattle. The perfect home base for us visiting friends and family. We appreciated the home's security and bathroom/shower updates. Host communication was excellent. Really an enjoyable stay within an easy drive to everywhere we needed to go. Plus pizza and Kubota garden. We had a great stay in this house. The playground and pizza place nearby were convenient, and the stream running through the front yard was beautiful.  Would absolutely stay there again. We were able to get into this house on short notice after another one fell through. Nice place, true to pictures and clean. Really liked walking up the street to the park and walking up the valley in the snow. Kids were able to sled in the park behind the house. Fun to watch the family get out of the car and look up at the trees, not realizing it was the creek they were hearing and not the wind. this was a wonderful home. very spacious with a clawfoot bathtub and open fully stocked kitchen and private creek. Our team of 4 got thier own room and bed.<br/><br/>the neighbohood is quiet and very family friendly. getting from renton area to downtown is a 14 min drive but there are plenty of shops in the area to visit.<br/><br/>the gate to enter the property isnt automated so if you have a car some one has to get out to manually unlock the gate. Clean and nice decorated house with everything we needed for the trip.   Host responded quickly to an unexpected issue.    Really enjoyed our stay. Very nice. Just what we wanted and asked for. 100/10 on our experience with Xiao. Responds quickly to questions and the whole experience was as painless as she could make it. The home itself was nice & cozy and equipped with the essentials you would need during your stay. It was perfect for our family of 7 and a safe enough space for kids to roam and explore within the house."

I like the one floor house compared some 3 floor townhouse it’s easy for everything. Ryan is very helpful with all questions and service. Great experience here. Our family had a wonderful stay at Ryan’s place. Check-in was easy; location was great with quick access to highway; house was beautiful and well stocked; great neighborhood with restaurants nearby. The location was great as it was close to downtown and easily accessible by car or bus. It is recently remodeled with new furnishings and very spacious and clean. Ryan was also very responsive to our questions and was a great host. Would definitely recommend! Ryan’s place was wonderful. Roomy, clean, and in a fun neighborhood. Our kids loved walking to Oxbow park (for the giant hat and boots), and we were only a short walk to downtown Georgetown!<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly recommend! Wow! This place is extraordinarily clean and well appointed. Great modern amenities, great neighborhood. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen and bathrooms looked newly remodeled. Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle! Really lovely house and feels like a miracle to find a true three bedroom. Stayed for a week with two co-workers for required work meetings. House is awesomely convenient to I-5, Marginal Way and 99 as well as restaurants and things to do in Georgetown (most are walk-able!). Incredibly clean and larger than expected, there was plenty of room for all of us to spend time together... or apart. Beautiful kitchen and laundry room. Quiet and secure. Look forward to our next stay. Ryan is an attentive and thoughtful host. Thank you! Great spot! Cute place - easy to get to and close to downtown! Nice house is a great location. Would recommend. this is a lovely homey home in a very charming part of town.  with a walking adventure in every direction  😀 We enjoyed staying at Ryan’s house in Georgetown. The house is remodeled and modern mixed with a little bit of rustic charm as described. Lots of room for a family with everyone on one story. Two good bathrooms one with a nice tub. The location is good for getting to the airport or Seward park, downtown on I-5 or getting out to the beach without staying at the beach.  There is some airport noise but that is common in many places in Seattle. Proximity to The Museum of Flight is a bonus, I was able to start the day with my toddler and then send her home for a nap while i continued exploring the planes! I felt secure and happy here for 3 nights with my family. Great location, clean, and charming. Our family was staying at Ryan's place as we attended a wedding in Seattle. This was my parents first time staying at an Airbnb, and they absolutely loved it! Plenty of space to sleep, eat, and hangout. We enjoyed our stay very much. Great stay, freshly renovated and well equipped house! Great location for what we needed and Ryan is VERY responsive. Probably the easiest check-in and check-out procedure I’ve ever had for a bnb unit. And the House was great, too. Ryan’s place is very clean, beautifully updated and nicely appointed with everything you might need. Beds are comfortable & linens are great. We appreciated the big luxurious bath towels!! Plenty of the basics:paper towels,TP, garbage bags, etc which a lot of rentals skimp on. Nice neighborhood, sweet front porch & fabulous fenced outdoor area with table & chairs. We had one small issue with having very few drinking glasses but as soon as Ryan was made aware he dropped off an entire set! <br/>The house is great & Ryan is an excellent host. We recommend this little gem! Nice spot near downtown. Great if you there as a business traveler Our family enjoyed our stay at this location.  Very clean and close walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops. Comfortable beds and cozy outside patio. Easy access to airport and downtown Seattle.  Would look to use again when we return to Seattle in the future. Hello from our Indiana travel tribe.. We enjoyed Ryan’s place so much.  Extremely clean, spacious yet private feeling.  The house was so comfortable, we didn’t want to leave.  Great location between Seattle and The Airport.  The bedrooms were  a great size with comfortable beds and bedding.  We will definitely try to stay next time we visit the area. This is really a gem of a place to stay… hope you all try it out. Beautiful, well appointed home. Charming neighborhood with llvely gardens and an amazing nakery a couple blocks away. Ryan was very quick to respond when we messaged him with some questions, and his response was super helpful. Ill definitely look for an opportunity to go back! A quick-to-respond host and a beautifully renovated and spacious craftsman house with cozy beds made for an excellent stay during our trip down south. The kitchen was equipped with brand new appliances and condiments, and the beds were all comfortable to sleep in. We enjoyed the outdoor space well as the indoor space. We loved the proximity to our targeted tourist sites, and appreciated the quiet neighborhood the house is situated in. The kids found it fun to hear the planes as they came into landing and take off from the nearby airport. We have bookmarked Ryan’s place for future Seattle trips! Lovely house, clean and well taken care of. Good location near freeway, restaurants and bars but in a quiet neighborhood with a cute park nearby. The whole family enjoyed it very much. Master bedroom door sticks slightly, in the way doors in older houses often do. I wouldn’t have noticed if I didn’t have a toddler I was worried about waking. Would recommend! This place was perfect! Clean, bright, with plenty of room for six guests. Super close to Georgetown in a beautiful neighbourhood. Highly recommend! We had a little mishap with our checkin but Ryan was great helping us resolve things and being very accommodating to our needs. The location is walkable to some great restaurants and breweries. We were there for business and had no issues with the wifi. Easy parking too. Ryan had a super cozy and clean home. It was perfect for my parents and grandparents. Very warm, comfortable beds, and a nice kitchen space. Only thing is you hear the planes overhead but still 5/5. Our family loved Ryan’s place.  It had all the amenities that made our stay extremely comfortable.  The location is perfect for sightseeing, eating and walking. We would rent Ryan’s house again.  Thank you for being a responsible and responsive host. My work colleague and I enjoyed our stay. We would be happy to stay there again. Close to job site, easy commute to down town Seattle, walking distance to local Mexican, Thai, Sushi restaurants. Ryan was very helpful - we arrived on an early flight and but we were able to drop our bags at the house before check in and once the cleaner was finished we were able to check in several hours early. The home was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!"

Would definitely recommend staying in this lovely home. Lovely home. Clean, pretty, quiet, peaceful, comfortable and well furnished. Fantastic location. Friendly neighbors. If you want to prepare gourmet meals and have guests, you’ll likely find it a bit challenging, but it’s perfect for a couple and guest. Loved our stay there. Cute house in a great location! 5 minute walk to the main street where you'll find lots of restaurants and coffee shops. Keep in mind, this house does have downstairs neighbors living below.

There are also some games and books which offer a homey touch. <br/><br/>Great central location to explore Seattle and surrounding areas in the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood. 10 minute walk to Kerry Park which offers some of the best views of Seattle.

The garden is beautiful, a great place for a quite rest! The Jewel Box is a hidden treasure tucked in a quiet unassuming neighborhood. Joline is an amazing host and made us feel right at home. The place is extremely clean, efficient, accessible, and serene. There is incredible artwork displayed throughout the home and garden that give this place a special touch. Joline’s place it quite with beautiful views all around, wether you’re inside or outside walking around you’ll love the scenery and the back yard garden is amazing. There’s trails and plenty to explore all around. I would happily stay there again if I’m ever in Seattle again. The Jewel Box is delightful!!! Smart layout, top quality furnishings, wonderful artwork, relaxing backyard garden and very accommodating host. I would highly recommend. The Jewel Box was a wonderful place to stay in Northwest Seattle. Walking distance to anything you might need, including the beautiful Carkeek park and beach. The apartment has everything you might need for a short or long stay, and the artwork in the apartment is beautiful and makes the space feel very homey. I really enjoyed my time in this place and would definitely recommend it if you need a quiet and comfortable place to stay. I loved staying at the Jewel Box.  It is beautifully decorated and cozy.  Looking forward to staying again. Great place to feel cozy while visiting the Seattle area. My partner and I rented the Jewel Box for a week while we looked for apartments in the area during our relocation. Joline was great, very helpful and kind, but also gave us the space we needed while figuring out our big move. She even gave us some eggs from her chickens and we made omelettes ! Very cute place and gracious host. Highly recommend! We are Seattle locals, so my dad stayed here while he was visiting us. Joline was a very thoughtful host, she communicated with us frequently to make sure we didn't need anything. The unit is clean, and has all the amenities one could need for a short stay, as well as complementary coffee fruits, and sweets. The stay overall was great, we would stay here again. This is a wonderful gem, cozy and private, with all the necessities. Joline is a thoughtful host and her garden is magical. I will definitely be back! One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve had. Check in was easy, the space was cozy, and Joline was so friendly and communicative. Highly recommend! The jewel box studio is a very special place in north seattle. All the touches are very thoughtful and we had everything we needed for a wonderful stay. The garden is luscious and green and beautiful. Joline was even kind enough to offer some of her fresh eggs and flowers for us! Simply wonderful. Joline has put so much love and attention into this space. It is personal, thoughtful and warm. The garden is a bliss, and blooming at the time I was there. The place is comfortable, has everything you need and as an experienced traveler I enjoyed coming to a place where things are just nice- nice cutlery, nice details. They seem like small thing but they made me feel welcome and at home. On top of that Joline is just wonderful, very hospitable and willing to help navigate the city and just really nice to talk to. If I good give 10 stars I would, but 5 stars it is. Thanks Joline, hope to be back. Joline is a very lovely host. She made our trip very easy and relaxing. The location is beautiful and is a short drive to a lot of desired locations. I would highly recommend staying here if you have the chance! Joline's place was just amazing. There were her thoughtful touches everywhere. She left fresh eggs (from her chickens) and drinks in the fridge and goodies (fruits and candies) on the kitchen counter. Oh, and don't miss a little present from her! She left a hand made glass fridge magnet!! So nice. Everything was very tastefully done. Arts everywhere. Clean and comfortable. Thanks, Joline, for a really peaceful and lovely experience at your place. It truly was a gem!! The stay was absolutely amazing. Joline is such a kind soul and her garden area shows the amount of love she has put in. Waking up in the morning to visit the hens and hummingbirds around the garden put me in such a great mood. The room had everything we needed and the pillows were so comfortable. We loved talking to Joline about her art and her animals that we felt as if we were staying with family. She also made my boyfriend a gift for his birthday! I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a tranquil spot while visiting Seattle. This is a gem! Clean, cozy, well equipped with everything you need! And Joline is a DELIGHT! The Jewel Box is truly a treasure! Joline is the consummate hostess: welcoming, accommodating, generous, and available for as much or as little interaction as you wish. The basement studio apartment is bright and cozy, and the yard is a serene haven. We were fortunate enough to be there at a time when Joline was able to share delicious eggs from her hens as well as greens from her garden. The location is also ideal. The house is in a quiet neighborhood very near the Interurban Trail, with easy access to Greenwood Ave, Aurora Ave N. and I-5. Jolene’s place was exactly what we were looking for. She was very friendly and great at communicating. Loved that she had local artwork on display. There is a reason Joline is a Super Host! Here studio is incredibly curated with many special touches from her own art as well as many others. Everything was sparkly clean and my stay was fantastic. Her studio is in a safe and very quiet neighborhood. Her communication and accommodations were exactly what I hoped for and made my stay in Seattle very easy and enjoyable!  I would surely stay here again. the studio was simply wonderful. Joline was a delight and I enjoyed my stay very much, I only wish I could of stayed there longer. the garden area was perfect and peaceful and relaxing in a space itself is very homey and comfortable. Jolene kept me well stocked on the vegetables so I got to eat like a rabbit which was delicious. the studio was one of the best airbnbs I've ever stayed at and I hope to again soon. Joline’s place is one of the nicest airbnbs I’ve ever stayed at. The garden is peaceful, and there were so many thoughtful touches around the room and courtyard. Especially good for an extended stay. Highly recommend! Joline’s place was absolutely perfect. The apartment was spotlessly clean with many amazing personal touches. The internet was incredibly fast and allowed for two people to work easily, including video conferences. The apartment has all utensils and kitchen items needed to make your stay easy. The highlight above all of this though, is the host and the yard. Joline is gracious and attentive as a host. All questions are answers quickly and she is easily available whenever needed. Her garden is so calm and peaceful with endless entertainment from her 3 hens. It truly is a diamond in the rough and we would gladly stay here again on any trip in the area! Joline is a delightful host and The Jewel Box is beautifully curated and oh-so-homey. It was wonderful to be able to come home to such a warm and inviting oasis for a few days. Bonuses include a stunning garden, good conversation, and 3 charming hens who laid a half-dozen delicious eggs which we were so generously gifted. I highly reccomend The Jewel Box! It was a wonderful stay nice and cozy Jewel box is tidy, cute little apartment equipped with everything you need. We were pleased with the stay.  This place is sufficient for a couple. It’ll be little congested for a family of 3 with an infant.<br/><br/>Joline is an amazing host. She welcomed us with a welcome note, flowers, gift, greeting card, cookies. We had a very pleasant stay.<br/><br/>She gave her blender so that we could prepare smoothies for my daughter. <br/><br/>We loved the lush green garden, my daughter loved her pet chickens.<br/><br/>This place is very near to space needle, aquarium, art museum, giant wheel, woodland zoo. There’s enough parking for the cars.<br/><br/>We would recommend this place to any couple who’s going to Seattle. Great place in a wonderful location. Walking distance to just about anything you’ll need. Near to Carkeek park that is a must!<br/> Joline is a wonderful and thoughtful host, even shared some of her sweet chickens’ eggs and delicious plums from her tree with us. Space was cozy and clean with all the accommodations we were looking for. Joline’s love for her home, garden, and art is apparent, and even inspiring. We hope to be able to stay again on our next visit. Thank you Joline! We found a little treasure with Jewel Box Studio. Not only is it spotless and has all the amenities we need, but host, Joline, made us welcome to the studio and her lovely garden.  The beautiful artwork and ambience gives Jewel Box Studio a warm and inviting character of its own. Joline’s place is immaculately clean and comfortable. The art work and colors made it feel homey and unique. Unexpected treats from the garden enhanced the stay. Joline was kind and generous, even helping us charge our Tesla . Her book had great suggestions for nearby eats. Wish we could have stayed longer. Great little spot just outside downtown Seattle. Private kitchen and bathroom gives a really nice hotel vibe. Joline is a great host who responds to any question or concern quickly. You will enjoy your stay at the Jewel Box! I needed a place to stay on a weekend trip to Seattle that was in a central location and affordable. Joline’s studio checked off those boxes and so much more. The studio was clean, tidy, and well decorated with local art and beautiful rugs. Despite the small sq footage the space felt very open and could easily work for two people. I was greeted by a beautiful card, flowers, and even some snacks. Location is close to everything you could need and parking was a breeze. This has become my go-to anytime I’m in town! The Jewel Box is by far the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in. Joline is also the sweetest and most welcoming host! The property is gorgeous with lush flowers, a serene sitting area, and a private garden. We loved the quick accessibility/privacy of the room. We would definitely stay here again! This airBnB is even more lovely and comfortable than the photos and description. The bed is very comfortable and the kitchen is well-equipped and laid out. Not only an excellent supply of dishes, coffee mugs, prep bowls and pots/pans but also an extensive set of cooking spices, coffee and teas for use of the guests. The refrigerator/freezer is new and clean and there's a microwave, toaster, blender, several types of coffee makers and a tea kettle. Extra pillows and comforters are stored in the cabinets under the kitchen bar. The atmosphere is very welcoming, decorated with bright comforters and pillows and original art created by the host and other artists. This subbasement apartment has a large window in the living and kitchen counter area that let's in lots of sunlight giving it an airy feel during the day. WiFi available with the password in the helpful information binder on the kitchen counter.  I'll definitely book this airBnB when I visit Seattle again. if it's available. One note: There's no TV. I didn't notice it until the fourth day there because I seldom watch television and had my laptop to watch NetFlix via wifi. Very pleasant stay Joline has amazing cozy place, with great communication and always went the extra mile with lending us an extra phone charger and also some allergy medicine!<br/>I highly recommend her spot, it’s so private and with your own entrance! A wonderful quaint, clean, and cozy place to stay. A great spot if you'd like something outside the downtown area (though near public transportation) and near some parks. Joline is very friendly and has made the space unique with many accommodations. Highly recommend! My best Airbnb experience ever! I stayed at the Jewel Box for a month while doing a school rotation, and Joline provided a restful nest that felt like home. Joline is the perfect host — attentive, communicative, and fully anticipating every need. The space is cozy, clean, and so thoughtfully arranged and decorated. The hot showers, speedy WiFi, and fresh organic coffee grounds were particularly appreciated, along with fresh eggs from the backyard chickens. Just an all-around wonderful experience. Eleven out of 10! considerate, polite and quiet host, cosy place with a more than adequate kitchen and a very comfortable bed. The Jewel Box is an absolute gem of a find. <br/><br/>The property is exactly as described and a perfect hideout for a couple or single person. <br/><br/>Joline was attentive and although my stay was cut unexpectedly short, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will definitely be returning. <br/><br/>Thanks Joline- hope to see you again soon in more normal times! A cozy find (with everything that you could need at such a good value) that I would be happy to return to someday! Bed was soft, water was hot, and Joline was very attentive during my weekend stay. I greatly appreciated the art and eco-friendly amenities, too! This cozy and colorful basement studio made a very pleasant retreat after full days with our grandchildren. <br/>The kitchen is well-equipped, and Joline made us feel welcome with a personal note and some special treats.<br/>We hope to return when the garden is in bloom to enjoy even more of her creativity. Joline has created a lovely space with everything you might need. I really appreciate that this studio has a full kitchen, nice bathroom, and comfortable bed. It is private and well located. Also, in warmer weather, she has a beautiful backyard area to enjoy. I also had the privilege of receiving a few of the eggs from her chickens and that was a nice treat. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay and it was great meeting you! I stayed at Joline's lovely Jewel Box for a long-term stay while I moved to Seattle and looked to get my own place. It was perfect for a single-person long-term stay as it had everything you needed - the kitchen in particular was very well equipped and made it convenient to whip up easy meals and not spend a lot eating out everyday during my long stay. Internet was fast and reliable, shower had hot water, and despite being a garden-level unit you got decent light and ventilation was easy if you let the window open for a bit. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a longer stay! It's a good place. Clean, neat, well-stocked. Nice location. Joline is a good and responsive host. Would recommend to other people traveling to Seattle. Beautiful and outstanding space. Immaculately clean. I would definately and wholeheartedly recommend staying here. Great experience staying in the Jewel Box. A lovely studio apartment with creative use of space. Having a place to make a real breakfast was a huge plus for me, and I enjoyed not having a t.v. Pleasant & quiet neighborhood. Joline is an awesome host, her place is clean, so comfortable and beautiful. I believe this is my favorite Airbnb of many I have stayed in through the US! Joline's truly created a wonderful, warm, and welcoming space for her guests to enjoy. The Jewel Box is cozy, comfortable, and filled with the most lovely art you can imagine. Every part of the experience has been thought through with intention and care from the flower arrangement there to greet you upon your arrival, to the warm lighting and gorgeous luminette nightlights that add to the magic of the space (check out her website for unique and perfect gift ideas!) The positive energy and love it was designed with are evident everywhere you turn your head. The garden is absolutely divine, and all of the chickens and hummingbirds that accompany the yard just add to the overall connection with nature, life, and one's self. I'm so impressed with how she's used her talents to create a beautiful respite from the world, an offering of what the world could look like with more art, generosity, and creativity. I left feeling renewed, hopeful, and truly inspired just knowing that the Jewel Box exists and that others will be experiencing similar states of bliss there in the future. My search for comfortable places to stay upon my future trips to Seattle are over as the Jewel Box has stolen my heart. Already looking forward to next time. Thank you, Joline. Joline was wonderful! Her place was clean and well kept. I recently moved to Seattle and I stayed here while apartment hunting. I’d highly this place, you will not be disappointed. Joline was awesome with communication prior to our stay. Jewel Box is a charming, well lit, art-filled space that had all the amenities available. Outdoors has grounds with a lovely restful garden in full bloom. Joline our host, provided flowers and other welcoming gifts including a recommendations for local restaurants and attractions. Joline is the most wonderful host! Before my arrival she sent me detailed instructions on how to get to her place and everything I needed to know regarding the apartment.<br/>During my stay we had a lovely chat in the garden and she was always available whenever I had a question. She even offered to take me to the nearest local train station. (Since I was traveling without a car and had quite some luggage.)<br/>The apartment was very well equipped with a comfy bed and blanket, a kitchen and a well working bathroom. I very much appreciated the opportunity to use the washing machine. If traveling without a car, you can reach the place via the local bus coming from the city center.<br/>Upon arriving, I was greeted with a personal welcome card and notes. All of which little details, that made me feel very welcome at this wonderful place. :) I definitively recommend staying at Joline's apartment! Cozy apartment very handy for those with a car looking to do things on the north side of Seattle. Joline shared her beautiful flowers and fresh eggs with us during our 2-night stay. Comfy bed and everything we needed to make a couple meals. What a phenomenal space for a stay! Joline has created an adorable, cozy studio apartment that has all you could want or need for a weekend getaway or an extended stay. It is furnished with very cool art work and if you enjoy it, you'll find information about the artists and how to order their works in her information book. (I had to buy one of her luminettes because they are just so cool!) In addition to providing a very cool sanctuary, Joline offered fresh eggs, has a spice rack for guests to season their own foods with, and even baked a pie that she shared with us. Would love to visit again if we make it back to the Pacific Northwest anytime soon. It's obvious Joline has put much thought and care and work into creating a beautiful place. The kitchen is completely furnished with everything you need. The space is very attractive and comfortable. The artwork is wonderful and interesting. The bathroom, in contrast with lots of places, has several glass shelves to hold all your required belongings, and the lighting is excellent for shaving or make-up. The sitting area in the backyard is comfortable and in a beautiful setting. Communication with Joline was easy and pleasant. I highly recommend Joline and her B&B! By far one of the best airbnb experiences i’ve had period! Joline was a wonderful and friendly host, and the art/decor in my room was fascinating enough to keep me occupied and inspired for a full night. The only downside is that Aurora, which is near the neighbourhood, is a little sketchy, but that didn’t detract from  the overall experience. Still definitely a must-stay for solo travellers like myself. The Jewel Box is the best!!!! Joline is an amazing, generous, friendly host. The yard is gorgeous and the chickens are adorable. The Bnb is very comfortable and relaxing. I would definitely stay again! All was well. Beautiful garden and excellent communication. Joline’s Jewel Box is a home away from home. The place has so much thought, intention, and style behind it. I did not notice a single thing that was missing or neglected. Joline is a great communicator if you have any questions or concerns and was so lovely to have a conversation with when our paths crossed. Loved all of the homey and practical touches. The location was in a great neighborhood that did take a little longer to use public transportation but it was not impossible. I had no problem on the day that I used a car since you can park right out front. One of the best Airbnbs I’ve ever stayed in. Highly recommend! super cute and cozy at the jewel box, there are great cut art pieces all over with a homey feel. Talking with Joline was a pleasure she was so kind and helpful whenever I had questions. She also left some fresh eggs from her kitchens, omg the best eggs I've ever had swear to God. I would 100% come back again if I find myself back in Seattle. The suite is equipped with everything you need, including a full kitchen. It’s quiet, clean, and comfortable. Lots of interesting art, pretty garden. Host is kind and helpful. Thanks for the fresh eggs and flowers, and the extension cord for my car. Would definitely stay here again! The Jewelbox is a lovely place to stay, beautiful, clean, and close to everything. Definitely would recommend! This eclectic apartment is full of artwork from local artists. It’s got a full kitchen that’s very well stocked with both dishes  and basic food staples. Also has a very pretty garden in the back for you to relax in. As a reminder, there’s not a tv, but that wasn’t important to me for my stay. Wonderful place! It was clean and homey. A lot of local art. Joline had fresh flowers in the airBnB that were beautiful. The garden was gorgeous. Great and quiet location! Would stay here again. Beautiful place! Love the artwork and thoughtfulness. Clean and organized. I would stay here again. Small tip, allocate about 20 or so mins at the end of your check out as there are several things that is asked to be done including removing bedding, taking out trash, washing dishes etc. overall,<br/>I would recommend this place. Very Nice basement apartment. Artwork everywhere. Especial;ly interesting to us was the backyard garden with its beautiful brickwork, glass filled shed, flowers, vegetables. artwork, ceramics and chickens. Jewel Box is absolutely wonderful, it has really set the new bar in Airbnbs for me. The space is a work of art and well-equipped, Joline was a great host and has a fantastic artistic sense. I had a great stay for several weeks. My second stay at Jewel Box.  This time my wife came along.  It's a very cozy space, quite nicely decorated.  Perfectly splendid!"

         "description": "This peaceful and colorful north Seattle studio mother-in-law is in the basement level of my charming 1949 house.  It is compact, cozy and well-designed for a feeling of spaciousness. The apartment's walls showcase the work of several local artists.  There is a separate entrance and a full kitchen. Wool area rugs are on comfortable and insulating rubber flooring.  You will find the fabulous country-style garden a tranquil place to read and relax.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The apartment is 362 square feet, which is not large, but the  space is maximized to feel surprisingly roomy.  Plenty of space for one person,  just fine for a close couple.  I would consider a parent with one child.<br /><br />The apartment comes with a comfortable queen bed, down comforter, blankets, cotton sheets, large antique oak dresser, loveseat couch, wide kitchen counter, barstool seating and standard size closet.   The entire space is private and separate from my own living area.  In the warmer months",
